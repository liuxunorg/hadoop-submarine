# Submarine support multi DC & Cloud

## Introduction
Submarine is built and run in Cloud Native, taking advantage of the cloud computing model.

To give full play to the advantages of cloud computing. These applications are characterized by rapid and frequent build, release, and deployment. Combined with the features of cloud computing, they are decoupled from the underlying hardware and operating system, and can easily meet the requirements of scalability, availability, and portability. And provide better economy.

In the enterprise data center, submarine can support k8s/yarn/docker three resource scheduling systems; in the public cloud environment, submarine can support these cloud services in GCE/AWS/Azure;


## Requirement

### Cloud-Native Service

The submarine system has two long-running services in the daemon mode, submarin server and workbench server. The workbench server is mainly used by algorithm engineers to provide online front-end functions such as algorithm development, algorithm debugging, data processing, and workflow scheduling. The submarine server is mainly used for back-end functions such as scheduling and execution of jobs, tracking of job status, and so on.

By splitting the services of the entire system into two services, both services can be deployed and scaled independently.

In this way, we can better provide the stability of the system. For example, we can upgrade or restart the workbench server without affecting the normal operation of the submitted jobs.

You can also make fuller use of system resources. For example, when the number of developers increases during the day, the number of instances of the workbench server can be dynamically adjusted. When the number of tasks increases at night, the number of instances of the submarine server can be dynamically adjusted.

In addition, submarine will provide each user with a completely independent workspace container. This workspace container has already deployed the development tools and library files commonly used by algorithm engineers including their operating environment. Algorithm engineers can work in our prepared workspaces without any extra work.

Each user's workspace can also be run through a cloud service.

### Service discovery
With the cluster function of submarine, each service only needs to run in the container, and it will automatically register the service in the submarine cluster center. Submarine cluster management will automatically maintain the relationship between service and service, service and user.

## Design



### Launcher

The submarine launcher module defines the complete interface. By using this interface, you can run the submarine server, workbench server, and workspace in k8s / yarn / docker / AWS / GCE / Azure.


### Launcher On Docker
In order to allow some small and medium-sized users without k8s/yarn to use submarine, we support running the submarine system in docker mode.

Users only need to provide several servers with docker runtime environment. The submarine system can automatically cluster these servers into clusters, manage all the hardware resources of the cluster, and run the service or workspace container in this cluster through scheduling algorithms.
